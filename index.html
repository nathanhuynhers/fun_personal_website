            <div class="intro-description"> I am a Junior at UC Berkeley majoring in Computer Science. I have a strong passion for software engineering and love diving into new challenges, whether it’s optimizing algorithms, building efficient systems, or exploring cloud computing. I’m always looking for ways to improve my skills, whether through hands-on projects, hackathons, or just experimenting with new technologies.

                Beyond coding, I enjoy trying new things and pushing myself outside of my comfort zone. Whether it’s picking up a new hobby, exploring different perspectives, or tackling a problem from a unique angle, I thrive on curiosity and continuous learning. At the end of the day, I believe in having fun while growing, and I’m always up for an adventure! I also like meeting new people, sharing ideas, and learning from different experiences.</div>

                <h2>Secure File Sharing System</h2>
                <li>Designed and implemented a secure file sharing system in Go, ensuring encrypted file storage and controlled access between users</li>
                <li>Architected the system from scratch, leveraging Go’s concurrency model and cryptographic primitives, achieving a 30% faster encryption and decryption speed compared to baseline implementations</li>
                <li>Applied security principles such as symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing, and digital signatures to protect user data</li>

            <div class="project-item">
                <h2>PintOS</h2>
                <li>Designed and developed a Unix-like operating system with system calls supporting concurrent user programs, process management, and file operations</li>
                <li>Optimized system performance by implementing an alarm clock mechanism and a strict priority scheduler, improving thread management and CPU efficiency</li>
                <li>Created a custom pthread library to enable user-level multithreading, enhancing resource allocation and execution efficiency</li>
                <li>Implemented advanced file system features, improving storage allocation, access speed, and overall system reliability</li>
